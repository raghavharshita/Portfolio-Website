								Iâ€™m Harshita Singh Raghav, an Electronics Engineering student at Kamla Nehru Institute of Technology, passionate about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and MLOps. My journey into AI began with a deep interest in mathematics, which naturally drew me towards algorithms and problem-solving. I took my first step into the field by working with OpenCV, exploring the possibilities of computer vision. This early curiosity soon evolved into a broader exploration of machine learning, leading me to master core concepts, advanced deep learning techniques, and modern deployment practices.

Over time, I have built a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms, which allows me to create efficient and optimized solutions. I love transforming the concepts of machine learning into practical, real-world applications that deliver tangible value. Along this path, I expanded my expertise into MLOps, learning how to version, deploy, and scale models effectively, as well as into state-of-the-art NLP frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers.

My dedication and problem-solving skills have been recognized through achievements like becoming a semi-finalist in Flipkart Grid 7.0 and securing 5th place in the Hackspire Hackathon. I continue to push my boundaries by combining engineering precision, mathematical thinking, and creativity to develop technology that is impactful, scalable, and future-ready.
